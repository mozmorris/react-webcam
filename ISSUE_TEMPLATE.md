## Please follow the general troubleshooting steps first:

- [ ] Is your app running over HTTPS? (please provide the URL if possible)
- [ ] Have you tried running the demo (https://codepen.io/mozmorris/pen/JLZdoP) on your device?
- [ ] Checked the latest "Can I use" compatbility table? (https://caniuse.com/stream)

### Bug reports:

If you can provide a minimal reproducible demo (CodePen, CodeSandbox, etc) or a GitHub repository, that will greatly help us to solve your problem. Many of the issues posted are questions about react-webcam usage. We don't discourage you posting a question, it's just a lot easier to help you if we can see your code.

### Features:

**Please note by far the quickest way to get a new feature is to file a Pull Request.**

We will consider your request but it may be closed if it's something we're not actively planning to work on.
